# RobotControl
A simple python library to control Dash and Dot robots from Wonder Workshop.

This python library has been developed by using the AdaFruit BlueFruit LE sniffer to capture communication between the iPad and the Robots.

It might contain errors or might not work anymore in future release of the robot firmware.

Using this library is at your own risk.
